# Building a GAN model for melanoma detection. Â 
Here we are provided with a dataset Melanoma skin cancer, however, only a small fraction of the images have been labeled. To overcome this challenge, I have employ data augmentation techniques, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning with GANs to produce the final model.

### Implementing a model for medical use from scratch with GAN (DCGAN).
### Only from 200 images & getting accuracy up to 75%
